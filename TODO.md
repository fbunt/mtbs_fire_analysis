# Project TODO Index

An index of todo lists across the repository. Use this as a jumping-off point to find area-specific tasks.

Last updated: 2025-11-10

## Area-specific TODOs
- Analysis package (renewal likelihoods and models): `mtbs_fire_analysis/analysis/TODO.md`
- Cellular Automata simulation work: (add if/when available)

## Existing docs and lists
- Rupert’s todo: `RupertTodo.md`
- Progress log: `memory-bank/progress.md`
- Decisions and architecture:
  - `docs/DECISIONS.md`
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  - `docs/ANALYSIS_PIPELINES.md`
  - `docs/DATA_PIPELINE.md`

## Conventions
- Each top-level area (e.g., `mtbs_fire_analysis/analysis/`, `CA_Simulation/`) may maintain a local `TODO.md` that is focused and actionable.
- This index links to those local lists to keep navigation easy while avoiding a single overgrown file.
- Prefer checkboxes for status, small acceptance criteria bullets when helpful, and short links to relevant code or docs.
