I don't even know what the better solution to these problems are:
 - For Survival times where we we have no fires at a pixel at all, we allocated nlcd to 2003 because it's in the middle of the dataset
 - For Fire intervals, we allocated the nlcd of the interval to the nlcd at the time of the first fire
