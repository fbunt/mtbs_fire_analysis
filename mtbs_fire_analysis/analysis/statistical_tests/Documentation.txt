These tests do a combination of:
- Simulate data in a similar way to how our data is sourced
 - Ie. treating the samples as coming from pixels and simulating our observation window
 - We can apply filters/adjustments that are present in our data
  - Left/Right censoring data
  - Filter out pixels that have no events
- Checking if the distribution objects are self consistent
 - Can we fit to the output data and recover our initial parameters
 - Does the distribution of the generated data match the pdf function


Mostly the above are checked by manual inspection of the plots and the fitted parameters
